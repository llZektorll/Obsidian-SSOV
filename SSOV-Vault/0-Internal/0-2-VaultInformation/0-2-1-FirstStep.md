# The Project 
SSOV (Student Start Obsidian Vault) is a project created for Obsidian October 2022. This year theme is **Back to School**. You can check all the information on this year event on [Obsidian Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/01+-+Community/Events/Obsidian+October+2022).
SSOV is a template vault with some examples on random topics created just to give an idea on how to use Obsidian. The project is divided into 3 sections that represented as folders.
1. 0_Temaples
	1. This will be the home to all the notes templates used for the project (Adapt all templates for your use case)
2. 1_System
	1. Here you will have the extended version of the Vault rules. Keep in mind that these rules are just a suggestion and they have been design based on my experience.
	2. There will also be a folder named Plugins that will have some basic examples on how to use the plugins that are available on this vault. 
3. 2_Exemples
	1. The Examples folder will have a set of notes as examples on how the vault can be used according to the rules. 


> [!ERROR] DISCLAIMER 
> *I'm not a professor and I do not have any training on teaching so this vault is designed based on my personal experience. As a result of that it may not fit your note taking habits or style.*
> *Keep in mind that note taking does not have a perfect or standard way that everyone uses/adopt. This project is only a guideline based on my personal use*

# Plugins used
This template vault uses several plugins, as a result i will leave some specific examples for each plugin as a reference under "2_Examples" folder. These examples will be simple and to be used as a reference.
