# The Project 
SSOV (Student Start Obsidian Vault) is a project created for Obsidian October 2022. This year theme is **Back to School**. You can check all the information on this year event on [Obsidian Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/01+-+Community/Events/Obsidian+October+2022).
SSOV is a template vault with a random note topic created just to give a general idea on how to use Obsidian.. The project is all inside a single folder to not take to much space on your file structure. 


> [!ERROR] DISCLAIMER 
> *I'm not a professor and I do not have any training on teaching so this vault is designed based on my personal experience. As a result of that it may not fit your note taking habits or style.*
> *Keep in mind that note taking does not have a perfect or standard way that everyone uses/adopt. This project is only a guideline based on my personal use*

# Plugins used
This template vault uses several plugins, as a result i will leave some specific examples for each plugin as a reference under "2_Examples" folder. These examples will be simple and to be used as a reference.
