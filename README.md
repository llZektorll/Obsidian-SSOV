# What is Obsidian?

**The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.**

**In Obsidian, making and following connections is frictionless. Tend to your notes like a gardener; at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph.**

# The Project

- Obsidian SSOV (Student Start Obsidian Vault) is a project created for Obsidian October 2022 event. This year theme is Back to School. You can check all the information on this year event on <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/01+-+Community/Events/Obsidian+October+2022">Obsidian Hub </a>, you can also check all the other project in <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-october-2022-daily-progress-and-learnings/43767/1">Obsidian Forum </a>

- SSOV is a template vault with a random note topic created just to give a general idea on how to use Obsidian.. The project is all inside a single folder to not take to much space on your file structure.

# Target Audience
- Although it can be used by any one that wants to, this project was designed to be as simple as possible so new users have an easier time to get started. 
- There is a very limited amount of community plugins used to not complicate the vault to much for beginners.
